# RN-Caculator
### Frist time to realize a caculator with react-native.
### I decide to learn about RN just for fun ,and now the caculator function will still being improved. 
### During the practice ,there's someting I want to talk about:
* The way to code css in js file makes me confused, can there be a perfect way to improve it ?
* Is there a design model to realize the caculator function,because there is a lot of edge conditions we need to "drag" it out.
* When I use RN to realize, I didn't feel any different compared using React, just the Component Tag we should use the native's, then the loader may transfer the react to the native laguage.But when bugs happens, you still have to know the native working mechanism, so the study cost is not low.
